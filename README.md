# CU Summer Internship With Metacrafters Project 04

## Degen Gaming Introduction 

Degen Gaming ðŸŽ®, a renowned game studio, has approached you to create a unique token that can reward players and take their game to the next level. You have been tasked with creating a token that can be earned by players in their game and then exchanged for rewards in their in-game store. A smart step towards increasing player loyalty and retention ðŸ§ 

To support their ambitious plans, Degen Gaming has selected the Avalanche blockchain, a leading blockchain platform for web3 gaming projects, to create a fast and low-fee token. With these tokens, players can not only purchase items in the store, but also trade them with other players, providing endless possibilities for growthðŸ“ˆ

## Gaming Clone Functionality 

**Minting new tokens:** The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.</br>
**Transferring tokens:** Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.</br>
**Redeeming tokens:** Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.</br>
**Checking token balance:** Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.</br>
**Burning tokens:** Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.</br>

## Steps To Deploy and Test Contract

To execute this program and interact with the "DegenGamingCone" smart contract on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet, follow these steps:

**Ensure Connection to Avalanche Fuji Testnet:**

Make sure your metamask are connected to the Avalanche Fuji Testnet using your MetaMask wallet, and you have some test AVAX (Avalanche's native cryptocurrency) in your wallet to use for transactions.

**Use Remix Solidity IDE:**

To run the program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Access Remix by visiting the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

**Create a New Solidity File:**

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new Solidity file by clicking on the "+" icon located in the left-hand sidebar.
Save the newly created file with a .sol extension, for example, "DegenGamingclone.sol."

**Copy and Paste the Contract Code:**

Copy the code from the "DegenGamingCone.sol" file (or "token.sol" file) that you want to execute.
Paste the copied code into your newly created "DegenGamingCone.sol" file in Remix.

**Compile the Contract:**

Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab located in the left-hand sidebar.
Ensure that the "Compiler" option is set to the latest Solidity version (or another compatible version).
Click the "Compile" button to compile the contract code.

**Deploy the Contract:**

After successful compilation, Before deploying a smart contract, You have to connect remix with your wallet, then navigate to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Select your contract from the dropdown menu, which should be named "DegenGamingCone" or similar.
Click the "Deploy" button to initiate the contract deployment process.

**Enter the Contract Address:**

Once the contract is deployed, you will receive a contract address. In the "At Address" input field, enter the contract address.

**Interact with the Contract:**

With the contract address entered, you can now interact with the deployed "DegenGamingCone" smart contract.

You can call various functions of the contract, such as minting tokens, burning tokens, transferring tokens, and more, directly within Remix without needing to specify the contract address since it has already been set.
By following these steps, you can execute and interact with the "DegenGaming" smart contract on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet using the Remix Solidity IDE.
